This project focuses on clustering cryptocurrencies based on their market performance using K-Means and dimensionality reduction techniques. By clustering cryptocurrencies, we can identify patterns and groups of similar assets, helping to uncover trends within the crypto market.

Project Overview
The CryptoClustering project utilizes clustering techniques to categorize cryptocurrencies based on price performance data over different time frames. We use K-Means clustering on both the original data and PCA-transformed data to observe the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering results.
